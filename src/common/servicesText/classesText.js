          Código Ecuador uses time-proven methods and curriculum from leading
          technology companies to train our students.
        </p>

        <p>
          We test new exercises, collect data, and see what best prepares our
          students for careers in technology. At Código Ecuador, we want to
          create an engaging learning environment that will instill in our
          students a creative passion for computer programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Código Ecuador's Python courses prepare students to go beyond basic
          Python to develop full-length applications to scrape websites, link
          information to databases, and visualize data. Moreover, they will
          learn to sharpen and fine-tune their intuition for solving common
          algorithmic puzzles.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the conclusion of the course, students will be empowered to use
          Python for software engineering, data science, and everyday
          automation.
