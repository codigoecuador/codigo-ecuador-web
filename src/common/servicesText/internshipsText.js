          At CÃ³digo Ecuador, we understand that learning must extend beyond the
          classroom. That is why we strive to connect our students with ongoing
          data science and computer programming projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hands-on experiences we facilitate gives our students the
          opportunity to reflect on challenging problems critically. Through
          experiential learning, the students build crucial skills in executive
          decision-making and analysis.

          We rely on partners to help us give our students the opportunity to
          put their skills to practical use on real-world issues. If you would
          like to join us in our mission, please contact us to learn more about
          the students in our program.
