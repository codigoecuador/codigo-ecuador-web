    "Ecuador has a beautiful culture of entrepreneurship where families and individuals start their own businesses and innovate outside of the confines of big corporations and creativity stifling bureaucracies. That is why we want to do more than give them technology skills so they can find a good job. We want to help them do what they do already: Create their own opportunities and control their own destinies."
