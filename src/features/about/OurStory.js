          At CÃ³digo Ecuador, we care about creating a more equal world<br/> between countries and across genders.
          <br/>
          We want to train young women to take on technology careers in Ecuador.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our world has a shortage of technology talent and our global economy is plagued by inequality. Advancing technological skills in developing countries opens up many opportunities that would not otherwise be possible.
