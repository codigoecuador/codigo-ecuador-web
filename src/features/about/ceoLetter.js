      <p>
      Dear Partners and Friends,
      </p>

      <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about our organization. Código Ecuador has been a goal of mine in some form for over 12 years. Upon just entering adult life at barely 18 years old, I began experiencing how difficult it is to make and achieve goals. If it wasn't for my first-hand experience in trying to pay rent and juggle work and school, it was for the people I knew in my community who struggled to support their families and live a fulfilling life.</p>

      ​

      <p>It wasn't in my nature to know that they struggled and not offer my support.  I probably tried to help too many people at such a young age. From the single mother recovering from alcoholism who needed someone to help her look for a job and drive her to work to younger teens confused because their parents drank and did drugs - I was there for them because I knew there was a gap in available services. I wanted to serve them and make life a little bit easier for them.</p>

      ​

      <p>I only became more empathetic to these hardships as I continued to grow up and experience the harsh realities of life. I took a path different than many other women in my position. It is easier for two people to support each other in a relationship than for someone to be single and without the help of a spouse or partner. I made a choice to attempt finishing college as a single woman because I didn't want to stay in a relationship out of convenience. Many low-income women have no choice but to enter into relationships with men and stay with them out of fear of losing that safety net.</p>

      ​

      <p>It wasn't an easy path that I took. That is why I want to connect women, in particular, to educational resources that will help them succeed. With the advent of the internet, there are many ways for people to gain skills without spending a fortune and getting themselves into debt. All they need to do is open up a search browser and find high return skills to learn for free on the world wide web. With our help at Código Ecuador, women in developing countries will learn about non-traditional education options to help them succeed in the world - on their own, without having to compromise their values.</p>

​

      <p>Thank you,</p>

      <p>Debra Ray </p>

      <p>Founder and CEO  of Código Ecuador</p>
