##Git Workflow
If you are new to git workflow on group projects, please practice a pull request as described in the file practice-pull-requests.md in the main directory of this project

General git workflow guidelines

1. Don't work directly on the master branch.
2. Create a branch for the feature you are working on
3. When you are on any branch, make sure you ONLY make changes to that branch's feature.
4. Make meaningful commit messages
   good: "made navbar sticky", "added cards for team members", "added about text" etc.
   not so good: "worked on navbar", "minor changes" etc.
5. When you think you're feature is in good shape, push your branch (directions on practice-pull-requests.md)
