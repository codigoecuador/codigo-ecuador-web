folks, if you're not used to making pull requests, here is your chance to practice!

##Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Make sure you have the latest version of repository
  git pull origin master

3. Do not work directly on the master branch.

4. Instead, create a new branch for the feature you are working on.
    git checkout -b pull-request-demo-<yourname>

6. Add your name to the bottom of this doc

7. Commit your change
git commit -m "added <myname> to practice-pull-request"

8. Push the branch, using the same name you gave it when you created it.
git push origin practice-pull-request-<yourname>

9. Navigate to this project's repo on github
https://github.com/joanrig/codigo-ecuador-web

10. From the menu bar, choose pull requests, which will take you here:
https://github.com/joanrig/codigo-ecuador-web/pulls

11. Click "New pull request" button (bright green button near top, at right side of screen)
under Compare and review just about anything, you should see the name of your branch. Select it. Then fill out notes, and click Create Pull Request.

12. If you reload the repo, you should now see a pending pull request. I will merge your request into the main project. The next time you view the master branch, you should see your name on this list!
